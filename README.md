# Documentation - DQMT File Formats
14-page technical documentation of proprietary binary file formats used by DQMT that I have reverse engineered.

The doc includes representations of data structures in C/C++.
([Documentation - DQMT File Formats.pdf](https://github.com/sebeid4556/Documentation---DQMT-File-Formats/blob/main/Documentation%20-%20DQMT%20File%20Formats.pdf))

Tools used:
- Python
  - scan.py: performs frequency analysis and scans file for certain patterns
- HxD (hex editor)
